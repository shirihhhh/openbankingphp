# Woocommerce TrueLayer Gateway

Woocommerce Payment Gateway plugin to allow for taking payments via [TrueLayer](https://truelayer.com/) Fintech OpenBanking API.

## Using

As this plugin is still in developer mode it won't work straight out the box. You will need to use composer to install some files.

1. Git clone the plugin

```git clone https://github.com/signalfire/woocommerce-truelayer-gateway.git```

2. Install with composer

```composer install```

You will need to have composer installed locally for this. You can find details of Composer at [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)

## TODO

*   Add cron functionality to check status of payment (as no webhooks currently)
